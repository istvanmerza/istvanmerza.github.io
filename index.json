In 2007 I started my professional career in IT Infrastructure / TechSupport. This was around the same time that the IT Crowd series came out. I remember being super jealous watching Roy wear an amazing shirt in every episode vs me having almost exclusively plaid shirts bought by my mom ðŸ˜‚. Getting some NIce-Tees! # So in 2010 I decided it was time for a change. I got myself the first few tees from Tomcat Polo (archive) and started to wear them at work. Previous Next These were an instant hit! Suddenly I felt like I am the \u0026ldquo;IT God\u0026rdquo; in the eyes of most people at the office. This of course helped me get some new friends / get conversations going.
